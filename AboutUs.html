            To protect people from being harmed or stalked, there will be a friend system that makes it so only the people you allow will be able to see your location. If an app user is not friends with you, 
            your identity will be anonymous. You will have to accept a friend request if you want others to see what event you are going to. Events are also only put on by establishments we have manually approved.  
            Click <a href = youtube.com> </a>here to learn more about establishments.

          On the first week of campus, everyone is desperate to meet new people and figure out, "What's the move?" There's only one problem - no one has a universal way to promote their events. On top of that, people who are looking for friends cannot figure out how to find them. 
          There's no incentive to go. You don't know if anyone is interested in this event, which de-incentivizes you from actually going out and trying to make friends. With What's The Move you will always be connected!
